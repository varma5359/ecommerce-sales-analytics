# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

**Project:** E-Commerce Sales Performance & Customer Analytics
**Role:** Business Analyst
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026
**Status:** Approved for Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

An e-commerce business generates thousands of orders every month. Management lacks a single view to understand sales performance, customer behavior, product performance, regional performance, and unusual transactions.

This project builds a **Streamlit analytics dashboard** that turns raw transaction data into KPIs, charts, statistical analysis, and management insights.

---

## 2. Business Problem

Management currently cannot easily answer:

- What is our total sales?
- How are sales changing over time?
- Which categories and products generate the most revenue?
- Which regions perform best and worst?
- What is the typical order value?
- Who are our high-value customers?
- Are there unusual transactions?
- Are discounts related to sales?

---

## 3. Objectives

### Primary Objective

Deliver a dashboard that answers all business questions from live data.

### Secondary Objectives

- Validate and clean transactional data automatically
- Calculate standard business KPIs dynamically
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis
- Identify potential outliers using the IQR method
- Segment customers by spending
- Provide downloadable results
- Generate plain-English insights and recommendations
